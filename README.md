## Structure
### Homework
Each week's homework assignment is located here. They will be numbered with the week and topic the homework assignment relates to. For example, 01-Excel will contain the homework assignment for week 01; It will cover advanced Excel functionality. Homework assignments are normally assigned the Monday of the relevant classes and are due a week from Monday(I.e. they are due Sunday evening). Depending on holidays, these dates may float around to accomodate the change in schedule.

### Lessons
Each week's lessons are located here. They will be numbered with the week and topic covered. For example, 01-Excel will contain the excel lectures from week 1. The individual lectures will lie inside of the week folders and will be numbered from 1-3. Before the first lecture of the week, all unsolved activites and possibly powerpoint slides will be pushed to gitlab so students can review the material ahead of time, if they choose. As activities are completed in class, the solved solutions will be updated here in gitlab. Also, a student and video guide are available in each week folder as an aid to students.
